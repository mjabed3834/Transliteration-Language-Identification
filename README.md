# Transliteration Language Identification

Transliteration, expressing one language using the alphabet of another, presents challenges in language identification due to differences in writing systems. This study addresses these challenges by leveraging a hybrid BERT-BiGRU model for identifying sentences in Bangla, Hindi, Tamil, and English. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with 98.77% accuracy, 97.57% F1 score, 99.15% specificity, and 96.74% MCC.

## Dataset
The transliteration language dataset contains samples from 12 distinct datasets, covering 4 languages: Bangla, Hindi, Tamil, and English.
